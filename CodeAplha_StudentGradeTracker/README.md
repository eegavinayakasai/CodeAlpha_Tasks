# Student Grade Tracker

## 📌 Project Description
The **Student Grade Tracker** is a Java console-based application used to manage and analyze student grades.  
It allows users to add, update, delete, and view student records, calculate subject-wise statistics, and generate summary reports using Object-Oriented Programming principles.

---

## 🎯 Features
- Add, update, and delete student records
- Store marks for three subjects:
    - Maths
    - Physics
    - Social
- Subject-wise calculations:
    - Average marks
    - Highest marks (with student names)
    - Lowest marks (with student names)
- Summary report of all students
- Identify:
    - Subject toppers
    - School topper (highest total marks)
    - Failed students (if any subject < 30)
- Grade system:
    - A+ : 90 – 100
    - A  : 70 – 89
    - B  : 50 – 69
    - C  : 30 – 49
    - F  : Below 30
- Menu-driven console interface
- Uses ArrayList for data storage
